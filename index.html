    <section class="panel" id="where">
      <h2>Where am I?</h2>
      <p>
        A place built from artifacts: images, objects, electronics, memories—reassembled into comfort.
        The outside is quiet. The inside is opal.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel" id="who">
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>
        VOIDTYPE is a brand, a practice, and a story engine. Upcycled tech. Handmade garments.
        Open-source process. A constellation of identities—held together by empathy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel" id="what">
      <h2>What is this place?</h2>
      <p>
        It’s a gallery, a workshop, and a portal into <em>Her Opaline Empathy</em>.
        If you want proof, you’ll get it. If you want lore, you’ll drown in it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel" id="why">
      <h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
      <p>
        Because comfort is armor. Because trauma is real. Because recycling can be sacred.
        Because “learn it yourself” is the only way to keep your sovereignty.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel" id="when">
      <h2>When did you realize?</h2>
      <p>
        The moment the shards started reflecting back. The moment the void stopped feeling empty.
        The moment art became a way to return something to the world—cleaner than you found it.
